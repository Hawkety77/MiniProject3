Step 1: Clustering text
- K-means
- Hierarchical clustering
Step 2: Follow-up analysis (significant manova, low misclassification, good elbows)
- Elbow and/or sillhouette
- PCA to visualize
- Manova to test significance
- Misclassification test
    - lda
    - qda
    - knn
Step 3: Interpretation and describe clusters
- Interpret discriminant functions (talk about variance explained too)
- Genre/Supergenre contingency tables
- Label clusters based on discriminant functions and genre distribution
